#  Red88 Poker - A Buyer's Guide to Texas Holdem Hands 

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, learning about Texas Holdem hands is critical to your success. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most common hands and what beats what in the game.

The first decision you need to make when playing Texas Holdem is which starting hand to play. There are 169 possible combinations of two cards that can be dealt in a game of holdem. However, only a small percentage of these hands are playable. The following list shows the hands from best to worst, according to the probability of winning: 

1. Royal flush 
2. Straight flush 
3. Four of a kind 
4. Full house 
5. Flush 
6. Straight 
7. Three of a kind 
8. Two pair
9. One pair 
10 High card (aces through tens)

	If you are dealt any other hand than those listed above, you should fold immediately and not waste any more time or money on that particular hand. Remember, the best hand doesn't always win - it's important to know when to fold if you don't have one of the top-ranking combinations.
Now that we've gone over the basics, let's take a closer look at each type of hand and what beats what in Texas Holdem poker:



	A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. It is extremely rare to get this hand and usually only happens when someone has been lucky enough to get four consecutive cards matching suit (e.g., 4-5-6-7). If two players have a royal flush, then the pot is split equally between them.

If you are lucky enough to get two suited cards on the flop (e.g., 3h-4h), then you have a straight flush - which is five consecutive cards all of the same suit (e.g., 6d-7d-8d-9d-10d). This is one of the strongest hands in poker and typically beats all other hands except for a royal flush or four of a kind.If two players have a straight flush, then the player with the highest ranking card(s) wins - for example, if one player has an Ace high straight flush and another player has a 9 high straight flush, then the player with the Ace high straight flush would win).If two players have four of a kind, then the rank of their four cards determines the winner - for example, if one player has four Aces and another player has four 2s, then the first player would win).If both players have full houses, then the rank of each three card combination determines who wins - for example: if one player has AKQJT and another has 22BBB, then the first player would win as their AKQJT would beat 22BBB).If both players have flushes, then the rank of each card within the flush determines who wins - for example: if one player has A♠ K♦ 2♥ 3♣ and another has J♠ 9♦ 7♥ 4♣, then even though both players technically have "flush" hands,the first player would win as their Ace would beat out Jace in second place).If both players have straights, then again it comes down to rank - whichever straight contains higher ranked cards would win (e..g A♦ 2♠ 3♥ 4♦ would beat 7♥ 8♥ 9♠ 10♥)If both players have threeofakinds they compare threesomes not pairs so A ♦ A ♣ K ♦ 10would lose against A ♥ J ♥ Q ♥ 8 even thoughboth contain threefacecards If bothplayershave twopairs theycompare pairs so K ♠ K ♥ Q ♣ 10would loseagainst J ♣ J ♠ 9 ♥ 8 .The highestpair would alwayswin . If bothplayers onlyhaveonepairthen whomeverhashigher rankedcardwins .Lastly ,ifbothplayershavehighcards ,theplayerwiththehighestcardwins .

#  Amazing Red88 Poker Hand Analysis 

Recently, a hand played by redditor "Red88" at a $1/$2 No Limit Hold'em cash game on PokerStars went viral. The hand in question was a huge underdog that miraculously won after hitting two consecutive fours on the flop.

Red88's hand is shown in the image below:

As you can see, Red88 is holding 2♣2♦ and is up against Q♥J♥. The flop comes 4♥4♦9♥, giving Red88 two pair, fours and deuces. This beats Q♥J♥ (one pair, queens) and results in an unexpected win for Red88.

Online poker players all over the world are still discussing this hand, trying to understand how it could have possibly ended up being a winner. Some commentators have suggested that Red88 got extremely lucky, while others believe that the player made some very skilled plays that resulted in the victory.

In this article, we will take a closer look at Red88's hand and try to determine whether or not it was truly lucky or if there were some underlying factors that contributed to the win. We will also look at some of the most interesting comments from redditors about the hand.

The first thing we need to do is take a closer look at the flop to see what made it so special for Red88. The flop contained two consecutive fours, which gave Red88 two pair - fours and deuces. This was enough to beat Q♥J♥ (one pair, queens).

It's important to note that not every four on the flop will result in a winning hand for a player with two pair. For example, if the flop contained 4♠4♦9♠ then Red88 would only have one pair, fours, and would lose to any other player with two pair or better. However, since the flop contained 4♥4♦9♥, Red88 managed to scoop the pot with his two pair.

So why did Red88's opponent(s) continuation bet (CB) on this particular flop? Well, one possible reason is that they had A-x or K-x and were hoping to hit an ace or king on the turn or river in order to win the pot. When you're up against an opponent who is continuation betting strongly on a dry board like this one, it's usually best to just fold your hand and move on to the next one.

#  Winning with Red88 Poker: The Best Hands to Play 

When you sit down at a poker table, the goal is always to come out ahead. There are various ways to achieve this, but the best way is by playing the right hands. This means knowing which hands to play and which to fold.

In general, there are three categories of hands in Texas Hold’em poker: strong hands, medium hands, and weak hands. Strong hands are those that have a high chance of winning when played against another hand. Medium hands are ones that aren’t as strong as the top category but still have a good chance of victory. Weak hands are those that don’t have a lot of potential and are usually best suited for folding.

Let’s take a look at some examples of each type of hand so you can start winning at Red88 poker today!

The most powerful type of hand is the royal flush. This is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit, starting with an Ace. Other strong hands include four of a kind, full house, straight flush, and three of a kind. These all have a high probability of winning when pitted against other combinations.

Medium-strength hands would be two pair, one pair, or high card. These generally don’t have as much power as the top category but can still be very successful when played correctly. It’s important to remember that two pair beats one pair, and one pair beats high card.

Weak hands are those that should generally be folded unless there is no other option. This includes pairs below two (e.g., 2 and 3), three mismatches (e.g., 5, 7, 9), and any hand with less than five cards (e.g., 4).

Now that you know which types of hands to play at Red88 poker, it’s time to put them into practice! Start by studying the different combinations and learning how to read the board before deciding which hand to put your money in. With a little practice, you’ll be on your way to becoming a winning player in no time!

#  How to dominate your opponents with Red88 Poker hands 

Online poker has taken the world by storm. People of all ages and backgrounds can be found enjoying a friendly game or two of poker in the comfort of their home. Millions of dollars are won and lost on a daily basis in the online poker world, and there is no sign that this is changing any time soon.

There are a few different variants of online poker, but the most popular by far is Texas Hold’em. In this variant, each player is dealt two cards face down (hole cards), and then five community cards are placed face up on the table. The player with the best hand using any combination of their hole cards and the community cards wins the pot.

Many people new to Texas Hold’em believe that ace-king (A-K) is an unbeatable hand. This is not true. There are plenty of hands that can beat A-K, such as a pair of jacks or better (J-J-T-9-4). However, A-K is still a very strong hand, and should be played with caution.

One way to dominate your opponents when playing Texas Hold’em with A-K is to “play the board”. This means that you should use your five community cards to create the best possible hand, regardless of your two hole cards. For example, if you have A-K and the board shows Q♥-J♣-10♦-7♥-2♦, then you should discard your king and play the queens instead. This would give you a winning hand against any other player holding only two hole cards.

Another way to win with A-K is to bet big when you have it! If you bet enough money early on in a hand, your opponents may fold simply because they do not want to risk losing more money against such a strong hand. Remember - just because you have A-K does not mean that you are going to win every hand; however, using these tips should give you a good chance of taking down your opponents when playing red88 poker online!
