If you're like most people, you probably enjoy a good gamble every now and then. But what if you could no longer access gambling apps on your phone?

It's not as difficult as you might think. In this article, we'll show you how to ban gambling apps on your phone.

First, open your Settings app and tap on 'General'. Then, scroll down and tap on 'Restrictions'.

If Restrictions is turned off, turn it on by tapping on the switch at the top of the screen. You'll be asked to enter a four-digit passcode.

Once Restrictions is turned on, scroll down until you see 'Apps'. Underneath Apps, you'll see 'Allowed Apps'. Tap on 'Gambling Apps' and then tap on the switch at the top of the screen to turn it off.

There are a number of reasons why you might want to ban gambling apps on your Apple device. Maybe you don't want to be tempted to gamble, or you have children who might be accessing the internet without your knowledge. Whatever the reason, it's relatively easy to do.

The first step is to open up the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Then, scroll down and tap on "Screen Time." This is where you'll find all of the features related to managing how you use your device.

Under "App Limits," tap on "Add Limit." You'll then be asked what type of limit you want to set. Tap on "Gambling." You can then choose how much time you want to allow yourself each day, week, or month.

You can also set a limit for specific apps. Simply scroll down and find the gambling app you want to restrict, then tap on it. You can then choose how much time you want to allow yourself for that app each day, week, or month.

If you ever want to change your settings, just go back into Screen Time and make the changes there.

#  How to Ban Gambling Apps on Android Devices

It’s no secret that online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. Unfortunately, this also means that there are a lot of scams and shady operators out there. To protect yourself and your device from these insidious apps, it’s important to know how to ban gambling apps on Android devices.

Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The process for banning gambling apps will vary depending on your device and its operating system. However, we can provide you with some general instructions that should help you get started.

For Android users, the best way to block gambling apps is by using a third-party app blocking tool like AppLock or AntiVirus Security Pro. These tools allow you to create a blacklist of banned apps, which will then be prevented from opening on your device.

To add an app to your blacklist, open the app blocking tool and locate the app you want to block. Then simply tap the “add” button and the app will be added to your list of blocked apps.

Alternatively, if you don’t want to use a third-party app blocker, you can also try restricting access to gambling sites through your device’s settings. This can be done by going into your browser settings and disabling the option to open links in new tabs/windows. This will prevent any gambling sites from opening in your browser, effectively blocking them from your device.

Whichever method you choose, it’s important to remember that vigilance is key. Gambling apps are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, so it’s important to stay on top of your game and keep your device protected against them.
