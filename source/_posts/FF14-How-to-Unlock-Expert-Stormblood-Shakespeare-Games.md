#  FF14 - How to Unlock the Expert Shakespeare Roulette Games

In Final Fantasy XIV, there are several different games that players can enjoy in the Gold Saucer. One of these games is the Expert Shakespeare Roulette, which can be quite challenging to unlock. In this article, we will outline the steps necessary to gain access to this game.

The first step is to complete the main scenario quest “Through Another Door”, which is available at level 50. Once you have completed this quest, you will need to speak with D Theme Park Attendant located in the Mor Dhona area of the map. He will then give you a quest called “D Theme Park - Roulette”.

This quest requires you to speak with three different people: Tylerman in Ul’dah, Requiem in Gridania and One-Eye Eddie in Limsa Lominsa. Each of these people will give you a task to complete. Tylerman asks you to gather 10 Circus Tickets, Requiem wants you to gather 5 Juggler Sticks and One-Eye Eddie requests that you bring him a bottle of Eau de Vie.

When you have collected all of the items requested by each person, return to them and turn in the quests. You will then receive a final quest from D Theme Park Attendant called “D Theme Park - The Show Must Go On!” This quest requires you to speak with One-Eye Eddie again and obtain an Admission Ticket for his show.

Once you have obtained the Admission Ticket, return to D Theme Park Attendant and hand it in. You will then be able to enter the Expert Shakespeare Roulette game!

Most FF14 fans are already aware that the Stormblood expansion unlocks new expert roulette games. The release of the new expac means that players now have access to two more expert roulette games: The first is the Each-way wager, which gives players a chance to win double their stake on either Red or Black; and the second is the Progressives game, which offers players the chance to win one of four progressive jackpots.

In order to unlock these games, simply complete the following three tasks:

1) Reach level 70 with at least one class or job;
2) Complete the main scenario up to (and including) The Eye of Kings; and
3) Complete all available sidequests in Ala Mhigo and Doma.

Once you have met these requirements, speak with Ukiyo in Kugane (x:11.8, y:11.4) to start playing the new games. Note that while it's possible to access these games before reaching level 70, they will not payout unless you meet the level requirement.

Each-Way Wager: This game is simple - just choose Red or Black, and if your chosen color comes up on the wheel, you'll win double your stake. It's important to note that this game is not affected by Enchanted status, so make sure you're playing with high stakes if you want a chance at winning big!


  Progressive Jackpot Games: There are four progressive jackpot games available in Stormblood - Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum - each with its own unique jackpot prize. In order to be eligible for a prize, players must wager at least 100 gil on the game. The jackpots increase incrementally based on how much money is wagered on each game, so make sure you bet big if you want a chance at winning one of these massive prizes!
