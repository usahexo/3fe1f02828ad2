#  How Does Jet Casino's Through Robin Sports Betting Work?

There are many different ways to bet on sports, but one of the most interesting is "through Robin" betting. This is a system offered by Jet Casino, which lets you bet on several games at once and share the potential payout if all of your selections win.

Here's how it works: first, you choose a number of games to bet on (between 2 and 8). Then, you specify how much you want to wager on each game. The total amount you're wagering is then divided equally between all of your selections. So, if you wager €10 on each game, your total stake is €80 - €10 for each game.

If all of your selections win, you'll receive a payout equal to the sum of the individual bets multiplied by the odds - just like normal betting. However, if only some of your selections win, the payouts are calculated based on how many winning selections there are. So, if you have 3 out of 8 winners, your payout would be 3/8ths of the total amount staked.

This can be a great way to spread your risk and maximise your potential payouts. It's also a fun way to bet on multiple games at once - perfect for fans who want to root for several teams at once!

#  How does the scoring work for through robin sports betting at Jet casino?

There is a set of point spreads, odds, and other information available on the official website of the company. But there are often inquiries about how the points are actually calculated. In fact, many bettors make protests believing their bets were unfairly taken or they could have made more money if they knew how the points were tallied.

There are two ways to look at it - either as a bettor or as a Jetcasino staff member. As a bettor, all you need to understand is which line is yours and how much your potential payout would be. The line that you choose is important, as it dictates whether you are betting on the underdog or on the favourite team. 

But what if you do not have enough knowledge about sports? What if you want to increase your chances of winning without spending too much time studying games? That’s where Jet Casino's through robin sports betting comes in - all you have to do is select one game and bet on the outcome. This removes any guesswork and allows you to enjoy watching the sport without stressing about making the right call.

Now let’s take a look at how points are actually tallied in order to give us our winning bets. Each sport is different and can be scored in various ways but we will use football (soccer) as an example. 

In football, there are three ways teams can score: goals, corners, and cards (either yellow or red). For each type of scoring event, a different number of points are given depending on how likely it is to occur. Goals, for example, are worth 3 points while corners are worth 1 point. If a team has more than one goal, then only the first goal is counted and so on. 

The points for each type of scoring event are multiplied by the odds for that particular event to give us our final score. This score determines whether we win or lose our bet - we simply compare it against the line that we chose when placing our wager. 

For instance, if Barcelona is playing against Espanyol and we think that Barcelona will win with at least 2 goals difference, then we would choose their line (which would be -2) and place our bet accordingly. We would then multiply 3 (points for a goal) by 2 (odds for Barcelona winning by 2 goals or more), giving us a score of 6. If this number was higher than -2 (the line chosen), then we would win our bet; if it was lower than -2, then we would lose our bet. 

As you can see, understanding how betting works doesn’t have to be complicated - all you need to do is figure out which line you want to place your bet on and make sure that your score is higher than the line chosen!
