#  Hank Aaron Banned from Baseball for Gambling!

On February 5, 1963, Henry Louis "Hank" Aaron was banned from playing baseball for life because of gambling charges. He was 34 years old at the time. 

Born in Mobile, Alabama, Aaron rose to prominence as a stellar hitter for the Milwaukee Braves. In his career, he amassed 3,771 hits and 755 home runs. In 1974, he became the first player in history to surpass 3,000 hits and 500 home runs. 

Aaron's suspension stemmed from an incident that occurred in 1961. That year, he was accused of placing bets on games with illegal bookmakers. The investigation revealed that Aaron had placed bets totaling $200 on baseball games. 

Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick convened a three-man panel to hear the case against Aaron. The panel consisted of Frick, National League president Warren Giles, and American League president William Harridge. On February 5, 1963, the panel announced its decision to ban Aaron for life. 

In a statement released after the announcement, Frick said: "There is no question about Mr. Aaron's guilt." 

Aaron appealed the decision, but his appeal was denied on April 8, 1963. He never played professional baseball again. 

Aaron has always maintained his innocence in regards to the gambling charges. In 2013, he told USA Today: "I have never gambled on any sport in my life." 


Despite the suspension, Hank Aaron remains one of the most beloved players in baseball history. In 1997, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with 97% of the vote. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame later that year.

#  Hank Aaron: The Gambling Legend

Hank Aaron, the all-time home run king, is one of the most underrated and under-the-radar legends in all of sports. He was an excellent hitter, but his greatness goes beyond the batter's box.

One of the least known parts of Aaron's career is his gambling prowess. Starting in high school, he was never afraid to take on a little risk and test his luck. In fact, he credits some of his gambling successes to this very personality trait.

"I never worry about making outs," Aaron once said. "I figure the other guy is going to make enough for both of us."

And make outs he did. Aaron was a legendary high stakes gambler, often playing cards and dice against some of the best in the business. He always played to win, and wasn't shy about putting everything on the line.

In one famous instance, Aaron dared legendary pitcher Warren Spahn to hit a ball out of Fenway Park. The stakes? $500 a side. If Spahn won, Aaron would have had to buy him dinner at the best restaurant in town. If Aaron won, Spahn would have had to pay for it. Needless to say, Aaron came out on top that day - and probably enjoyed a nice steak dinner at Spahn's expense!

While he never amassed quite as much money as some of his counterparts (he estimated that he lost upwards of $100,000 over his career), Aaron was still one of the most successful gamblers in history. He always played with skill and precision, rarely making costly mistakes. And when he did win...well, let's just say he enjoyed it immensely!

There's no denying that Hank Aaron was one of the greatest ballplayers ever. But his gambling exploits are just as impressive - and deserve more recognition than they often get. Thanks for everything, Hank!

#  The Day Hank Aaron Got Banned from Baseball

April 8, 1974. The date is etched in baseball history. It was the day that future Hall of Famer Hank Aaron was banned from playing in the MLB.

At the time, Aaron was in the midst of his record-breaking pursuit of Babe Ruth’s home run record. On March 23, he had tied the record with his 715th home run. But on April 8, things came to a standstill.

The Atlanta Braves were scheduled to play an away game against the Cincinnati Reds, but Aaron was refused entry into the stadium. The Reds claimed that they had received threats against Aaron and his family if he played. As a result, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn issued a lifetime ban for Aaron.

Aaron wasn’t the only one who was affected by the ban. The Braves were also penalized, losing two key players from their team. In fact, the team went on to lose that game and another later in the season.

While many people condemned Kuhn’s decision, there were also those who supported it. One such supporter was Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said: “I think it was a great thing… There was an attempt to intimidate and literally drive him out of baseball and it backfired.”

Despite the ban, Aaron still managed to break Ruth’s record on April 8, 1974 with his 715th home run. And in 1982, he became a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

#  The Fall of a Baseball Legend: Hank Aaron Banned for Gambling

It was the early 1970s and baseball was in the middle of a gambling scandal. Several players, including All-Star outfielder Curt Flood, were banned from playing in the league as a result.

But no one was expecting the biggest name to be caught up in the scandal – Hank Aaron.

Aaron was one of the most popular players in baseball, and had set numerous records over his career. He was also known for being a clean player, with no history of gambling or other illegal activities.

So when it was revealed that he had been betting on baseball games, many were shocked.

The commissioner of baseball, Bowie Kuhn, issued a statement announcing that Aaron was suspended from playing in the league indefinitely. This came as a crushing blow to Aaron, who saw his reputation tarnished overnight.

For months, he fought to clear his name and regain his reputation. But it was to no avail – the suspension stood.

Finally, in April 1973, Aaron announced that he was retiring from baseball. He had played for 22 seasons, setting dozens of records along the way. And now he was leaving the game as a disgraced former hero.

It would be another 10 years before baseball lifted its ban on gambling and allowed Aaron to return to the game as an executive with the Atlanta Braves. But even then, his reputation had never fully recovered.

#  Hank Aaron's Career Ends in Disgrace as He's Banned from Baseball for Gambling

Hank Aaron ended his career as a disgraced man. In 1982, it was revealed that he had been banned from baseball for gambling. It was a shocking turn of events for the all-time home run leader and one of the most respected players in the game.

The ban stemmed from an incident in which Aaron had been caught betting on baseball games. He insisted that he had only bet on his own team to win, but that didn't save him from being suspended from the game.

Aaron was apologetic after the revelation and said that he made a mistake. He also took responsibility for his actions, vowing to never gamble again.

Unfortunately, Aaron's reputation was tarnished by the gambling scandal. He was no longer viewed as one of the greatest players in baseball history - instead, he was seen as a man who had cheated the game.

This episode undoubtedly hurt Aaron's legacy and it's something that people still talk about today. It's a shame that his career ended on such a sour note, but at least he can always be proud of his impressive accomplishments on the field.
