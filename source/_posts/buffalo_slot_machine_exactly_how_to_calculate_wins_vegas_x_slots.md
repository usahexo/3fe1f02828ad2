# Buffalo Slot Machine: How to Calculate Wins

The Buffalo slot machine, created by Aristocrat Gaming, is a popular game found in many casinos around the world. This game features five reels, four rows, and up to 1,024 paylines. The goal of the game is to match symbols on adjacent reels, from left to right, in order to earn payouts. In this article, we will discuss how to calculate wins on the Buffalo slot machine.

## Understanding the Paytable

Before we dive into calculating wins, it is important to understand the paytable. The paytable lists all of the possible winning combinations and their corresponding payouts. In the Buffalo slot machine, the paytable can be accessed by clicking the “i” button on the game screen.

The paytable lists the payouts for each symbol combination based on the number of symbols that match on adjacent reels. The payouts increase with each additional matching symbol.

## Calculating Wins

To calculate a win on the Buffalo slot machine, you need to multiply the payout for the winning symbol combination by the number of paylines that the combination appears on. For example, if you have three buffalo symbols on adjacent reels and they appear on paylines 1, 2, and 3, you would calculate your win as follows:

- Payout for three buffalo symbols: 10x your bet
- Number of paylines: 3
- Win amount: 10 x 3 = 30x your bet

If you have multiple winning combinations on a single spin, you would calculate the win for each combination and add them together to get your total win for the spin.

It is important to note that the Buffalo slot machine uses a “MultiWay Xtra” system, which means that matching symbols can appear in any position on adjacent reels, as long as they are on the same payline. This increases the chances of winning on each spin, but also makes calculating wins more complex.

## Conclusion

Calculating wins on the Buffalo slot machine is a simple process once you understand the paytable and how to multiply payouts by the number of paylines. While the game may seem complicated at first, it is easy to get the hang of and can provide hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels.
