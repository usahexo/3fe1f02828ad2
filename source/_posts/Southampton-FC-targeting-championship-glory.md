#  Southampton FC targeting championship glory

Southampton FC are making a serious push for promotion to the Premier League, with manager Ralph Hasenhüttl at the helm.

The Saints have been in excellent form in recent months, and currently sit in second place in the Championship table behind Brighton & Hove Albion.

Hasenhüttl has instilled a high-intensity, attacking style of football at Southampton, which has yielded some impressive results.

The club will be looking to go one step further this season and achieve promotion to the top flight.

They have a strong squad which is capable of achieving this goal, and they will be hoping to secure automatic promotion rather than going through the play-offs.

Southampton have made some impressive signings in the January transfer window, including striker Che Adams from Birmingham City.

Adams is a proven goalscorer at this level, and he will be a key player for Southampton as they push for promotion.

Other signings include midfielder Mohamed Elyounoussi from FC Basel and defender Jan Bednarek from Lech Poznań.

Bednarek is an exciting young talent who has already made his mark in the Premier League with Southampton’s rivals Liverpool.

The competition for places in the Southampton squad is high, but that will only spur the players on to achieve their goals.

The club’s fans are excited about what lies ahead, and they will be hoping that their team can achieve promotion to the Premier League this season.

#  Saints sign Dutch international defender Virgil van Dijk

The New Orleans Saints have announced the signing of Dutch international defender Virgil van Dijk on a six-year deal worth £75 million.

The 26-year-old has been one of the most sought-after players in Europe since his break-out season with Southampton in 2015/16, and he becomes the most expensive defender in history.

“I am really happy and excited to be here,” van Dijk said. “I can’t wait to get started. I am looking forward to playing with my new team-mates and helping the club achieve something special.”

Saints boss Mauricio Pellegrino added: “Virgil is a world-class player and we are thrilled to have him join us here at Southampton.

“He has shown himself to be one of the strongest defenders in the Premier League and we believe he will make a huge impact for us both on and off the pitch.”

Van Dijk began his career with hometown club FC Groningen before moving to Celtic in 2013. After two successful seasons in Scotland, he signed for Southampton in 2015 and has since made 83 appearances for the club, scoring six times.

He made his international debut for Netherlands in 2015 and has since won 16 caps, scoring once.

#  Graziano Pelle: A striker for all seasons?

Graziano Pelle is a name that has been on the lips of many Southampton fans in the last few seasons. The big Italian striker has always been a fan favourite since his arrival at the club from Feyenoord in 2014.

Pelle’s first season at Southampton was a successful one as he helped the club to an eighth-placed finish in the Premier League. He managed to score 11 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions. His second season was not as successful as he only managed to score six goals in 36 appearances. This could be due to the fact that he was played out of position a lot of times during this season.

Pelle’s third and final season at Southampton was his best one yet as he scored 14 goals in 37 appearances. He also led the team to their best ever finish in the Premier League of sixth place. This season saw Pelle play as a centre-forward for most of the season and it paid off dividends for both him and Southampton.

It wasn’t just his goal-scoring exploits that caught the eye of many clubs during this season, but also his overall performances for Southampton. His hold-up play, aerial ability and strength were all on show for all to see this season. This led to him being linked with moves away from Southampton, with clubs such as Everton, West Ham United and Chelsea all being interested in signing him.

In the end, Pelle decided to join Chinese Super League side Shandong Luneng Taishan on a three-year deal worth £13 million. This move came as a bit of a surprise to many Southampton fans, but they can take solace in the fact that they managed to get £13 million for a 30-year-old striker who is coming towards the end of his career.

So, what can we expect from Graziano Pelle at Shandong Luneng Taishan? One thing is for sure, Pelle will be looking to score plenty of goals for his new club and help them win some silverware. He will also be looking to make an impact in the Chinese Super League and prove that he is still a top striker worthy of playing at the highest level.

#  Fraser Forster - England's number one?

Fraser Forster has been in splendid form for Southampton this season and he is currently the first choice goalkeeper for England. Forster was called up to the England squad for the first time in November 2012, but he had to wait until March 2016 for his first cap. He started his international career well by keeping a clean sheet against Germany.

Forster made his Premier League debut for Newcastle United in August 2007 and he went on to make 45 appearances for the club. He joined Celtic in 2010 and he played a key role in their successful title campaigns. Forster also helped Celtic reach the last 16 of the Champions League in 2013/14.

Southampton signed Forster in 2014 and he has since made 109 appearances for the club. He has been an ever-present this season as Southampton have climbed to seventh place in the Premier League table.

Forster has developed into one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and his performances for Southampton this season have shown that he is capable of playing at the highest level. He has proved that he is good enough to be England's number one goalkeeper and he will be hoping to keep a clean sheet against Scotland on Saturday.

#  Ronald Koeman - Premier League Manager of the Season

After a turbulent season at Everton, Ronald Koeman has been rewarded with the Premier League Manager of the Season award.

The highlight of the Dutchman's season was undoubtedly his side's impressive run to the FA Cup final. Although they eventually lost to Manchester United, Koeman's side put up a great fight and impressed many with their passing football.

In the Premier League, Everton also performed well above expectations. They finished in 7th place, which is Everton's best finish since the 2007/08 season.

Koeman has been praised for his attacking philosophy and for bringing through some talented young players, such as Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku.

Everton fans will be hoping that Koeman can build on this success next season and bring some silverware to Goodison Park.
