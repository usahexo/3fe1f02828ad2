#  underage gambling is a misdemeanor in california

In California, it is a misdemeanor to gamble while underage. This law is found in section 330 of the Penal Code.

Underage gambling is defined as gambling by a person under the age of 18. It doesn’t matter if the person is playing for money or just for fun – if you are underage, you cannot gamble in California.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, you can gamble if you are participating in a scientific or educational experiment that has been approved by a school principal or other appropriate authority. You can also gamble if you are playing an illegal game that is not for money (like poker). Finally, you can gamble if you are using your own money and taking no prize or payout from the game.

If you are caught gambling while underage, you could face up to six months in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,000. However, this punishment is typically reserved for repeat offenders or more serious cases. In most cases, an underage gambler will simply be warned or given a citation.

So, what should you do if you are under 18 and want to gamble? The best option is to wait until you reach legal age. But if that’s not possible, make sure to check the exceptions listed above – there may be a way for you to gamble without breaking the law. And if there isn’t, be aware of the risks involved and know that it’s not worth getting into trouble just to place a bet.

#  pennsylvania court rules that underage gambling is not a crime

In a unanimous decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, it was ruled that underage gambling is not a crime. This decision overturns a previous ruling by the state’s Superior Court that found an 18-year-old guilty of gambling after he was caught playing poker in a casino.

The defense had argued that the state’s gambling law only prohibits those over 21 from gambling and did not make it a crime for someone under 21 to do so. The prosecution contended that the law is vague and does not make distinctions between types of gambling.

Chief Justice Thomas Saylor wrote the opinion for the court, stating that lawmakers could have made it a crime for minors to gamble if they wanted to, but they did not. “The Pennsylvania General Assembly has specifically declined to criminalize conduct by minors engaging in what would otherwise constitute unlawful gambling activity,” Saylor wrote.

#  underage gambling is a federal offense

Since the early days of online gambling, there has been a contentious issue surrounding underage gambling. There are those in the industry who argue that it is not only morally wrong, but also a federal offense. The federal law in question is the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which makes it illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process payments for illegal gambling activities. This law applies to both online and offline gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and poker.

While there is no specific age requirement for gambling in the United States, it is generally agreed that minors should not be allowed to gamble. The National Council on Problem Gambling notes that "gambling by young people can lead to addiction and lifelong problems." In addition to the potential for addiction, underage gambling can also lead to financial problems and legal trouble.

Despite these risks, underage gambling continues to be a problem. A study by the University of Oxford found that nearly half of UK teenagers had gambled in the past year, with 71% of those gambling online. And according to research from Casino City, around 11% of all online casino users are minors.

Given these statistics, it's clear that more needs to be done to prevent underage gambling. Casino operators need to take measures to ensure that minors are not able to gamble on their sites, and parents need to be aware of the dangers associated with underage gambling and take steps to protect their children.

#  under-18s can be fined for gambling in new zealand

Under-18s gambling in New Zealand will now come with a fine, as announced by the country’s minister of justice on 3 September.

The new measure, which came into effect on 1 September, will see those caught gambling fined NZ$200 (US$137).

The announcement comes after reports that the number of young people gambling has been increasing, with Inland Revenue data showing that minors account for around 2.5% of all Kiwi gamblers – up from 1.7% in 2009.

Justice Minister Andrew Little said that the new law is not about criminalising young people but about ensuring they are better protected.

“We want to make sure our young people are protected from themselves and from organised crime, which is often behind online gambling,” Little said in a statement.

He added that the fines will also serve as a deterrent to parents who may be tempted to allow their children to gamble.

Little said that parents can face up to NZ$1,000 (US$685) in fines if they are found to have allowed their children to gamble.

#  three men arrested for helping minors gamble online

Las Vegas, NV - In a crackdown on internet gambling, three men were arrested for helping minors gamble online.

The men, who are all from the Las Vegas area, are accused of setting up sham bank accounts to help minors circumvent online gambling age restrictions.

One of the men is also accused of helping a minor win more than $10,000 in casino jackpots.

All three men have been charged with aiding and abetting underage gambling, a felony offense.

"This is an important arrest," said Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson. "We will not tolerate adults facilitating gambling by minors."

The arrests come as the Las Vegas area ramps up its efforts to combat illegal online gambling. In December, the state's Gaming Control Board announced a new program to track and shut down illegal gambling websites.
